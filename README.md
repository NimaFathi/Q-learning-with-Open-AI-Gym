# Q-learning-with-Open-AI-Gym
Q-learning on Taxi-v2 and Pendulum-v0 environments.<br>
# Intro
In this Repo my purpose was to dive into Reinforcement Learning.<br>
One of the easiest and first algorithms in this profession is Q-learning.<br>
Q-learning is an algorihtm that works best for problems with discrete state and action spaces.<br>
To work with Reinforcment Learning I use [Open AI Gym](https://gym.openai.com) that is a library with a lot of perfect game environments that you can use to see how your code works.<br>
you can see all possible environments in <b>[Here](https://gym.openai.com/envs/#classic_control) <b> .
# Overview
1- <b>Taxi-v2</b> is a problem with discrete state and action spaces so that is perfect match for Q-learning.
The problem is we want to pick up passenger in one of 4 marked cells and deliver him/her to one of 4 marked destinations.<br>
State space is roughly 500 and action space is 6.<br>
 2- <b>Pendulum-v0</b>
is a little different with both state and action space continuous.<br>
To use Q-learning one of ideas is to define limited number of states and actions and change or spaces into some imaginary discrete one and the use Q-learning.
